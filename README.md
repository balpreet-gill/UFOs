# UFOs

## Purpose of UFO sightings 
- Throughout the module, webpage and dynamic table are working as intended with one filter to filter the data of UFOs Sightings, the challenge for this module was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing the users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, in addition to date, the filter for the city, state, country and shape are also created. 

## Results 
- The final webpage has multiple filters created as shown in the picture.
- The second picture shows the filter created for 1/2/2010 to narrow down the search.

## Summary 
### Drawback 
- The filter search is very narrow, such that it does not show related results but only the exact matches. 

### Recommendations 
- It would be good if the filter has a drop down with all the available options and for the date a calender view where a user can select the exact date and it gets auto filled. 
- The data.js used in this webpage is only from 2010, it would be good if real time data is shared from the UFO sightings instead of a specific year alone.
